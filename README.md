devcontainer for working with the pyo3 codebase

To use: simply checkout as a subdirectory named `.devcontainer`in your pyo3 fork, make sure you have
the devcontainer extension installed in vscode and then "reopen in container".

Note: currently this will not work with intelliJ as it needs a load of extra packages installing in
the docker, which I haven't added yet.
